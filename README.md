# NevosDescriptionMaker
It's a thing to make my description

I'm not a programmer, I'm a blob.

## How to run
Basically just get an osu! api clientid and secret and input them when prompted.
1. https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit
2. New OAuth application
3. Call it whatever
4. Get the ClientID and secret and input when prompted (it will get saved to a local file for future runs)
